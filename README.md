# tic-tac-toe

## Background

The 3T Corp has decided to take the famous paper-and-pencil game, tic-tac-toe, to the web! 3T has contacted The Gnar Company to work with their team to build the web version of tic-tac-toe. As the engineer assigned to the project, you are tasked with building an API that allows users to create new games, marking a player's move on the board, and decide the winner of the game. More information on the rules of tic-tac-toe can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

## Tasks

* Create a data model that facilitates creating a game and marking a move on the board.
* Build an API with endpoints for creating a game and marking a move on the board.
* The API response when marking a space on the board should inform the front-end of the moves taken in the game, and whether or not there is a winner at this point in the game.
* Submit your code as a Pull Request in this repository.

## Assumptions

* No user records or user auth is required, the 2 players can be assumed to alternate turns.
* 3T will handle the front-end development, only the API is required from The Gnar Company team.
* This will be the API code that ships to production
* You may add any tool, framework, or technology to complete the task.
* Please feel free to ask questions about the project with other Gnar Team Members.
* 3T has booked no more than 4 hours of your time!
